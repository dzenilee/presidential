I said from the beginning that if, in fact, Trump continued to stonewall what the Congress is entitled to know about his background, what he did, all the accusations in the Mueller Report, if they did that, they would have no choice — no choice — but to begin an impeachment proceeding, which gives them more power to seek more information.",Atlanta-GA,0,0,0,1,53.088569353667395,7,0.5,13.45,1,0,0,5,64,2,32.0,29.0,356
